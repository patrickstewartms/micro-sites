			p In April 2005, Women Against MS (WAMS) launched in Canada and inducted National MS Society WAMS Chair Teri Garr as an honourary member. Since its inception, WAMS in Ontario has raised over $3 million.
			p WAMS is a powerful collective of professional women dedicated to raising funds to end MS, while participating in exclusive networking opportunities in the GTA. 
			p Thanks to the incredible contributions of our supporters, WAMS successfully funded the Transitional Career Development Award, a 5-year grant worth $500,000. The grant was awarded to fund the last two years of Dr. Cornelia Laule’s postdoctoral study, as well as her first independent MS or MS-related faculty position within a Canadian university or teaching hospital.
			p Dr. Laule has now completed her postdoctoral fellowship and has been appointed Assistant Professor in the Departments of Radiology and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of British Columbia. Her research focuses on developing magnetic resonance techniques to study the pathology of multiple sclerosis.
			p In 2014 and 2015, funds raised by WAMS in Ontario were directed to a three-year operating grant for a gender-based study of neuropathic pain conducted by Dr. Bradley Kerr from the University of Alberta. 
			p Thanks to WAMS we're able to fund a new generation of groundbreaking researchers as we endeavour together to end MS.
